# Appointment-Manager-
A program used to schedule users appointments, modify existing appointments, and delete appointments not needed in the system. Includes databases with an entity relationship diagram. Created in Java Using Netbeans as the IDE. I had to delete some files in order to make it fit on github. The capacity was too big
